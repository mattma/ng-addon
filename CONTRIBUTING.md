## Local Development Setup 

    git clone https://github.com/mattma/ng-addon.git
    cd ng-addon
    npm link

`npm link` is very similar to `npm install -g`, except that instead of downloading the package from the repo the just cloned **ng-addon/** folder becomes the global package. Any changes to the files in the **ember-rock/** folder will immediately affect the global **ng-addon/** package.
